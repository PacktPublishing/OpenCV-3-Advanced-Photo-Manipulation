# OpenCV 3 Advanced Photo Manipulation [Video]
This is the code repository for [OpenCV 3 Advanced Photo Manipulation [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-3-advanced-photo-manipulation-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788298261), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
OpenCV 3 is a native cross platform C++ Library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCVâ€™s convenient high-level APIs hide very powerful internals designed for computational efficiency. With a strong focus on real-time applications, it can take advantage of multi-core and GPU processing. OpenCVâ€™s vast functionality makes it useful from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or advanced robotics.

In this course, youâ€™ll step into the world of photography manipulation, where what you see is just a starting point for what you get. The course is divided into different projects that will take you through the art creating image editing tools and effects that appear to magically work and learn the secrets of creating HDR images. Moving on, get a hands on experience in building Apps to modify and combine photos in the gradient domain. 

Finally, weâ€™ll move on to the OpenCV 3 - Space Exploration App project and you will learn how images are stitched to create mosaics or panoramas. Weâ€™ll explore extraterrestrial planets with our interplanetary satellite and rover. By the end of this course, you will be able to tackle increasingly challenging computer vision problems that you may face in your careers.
